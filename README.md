# Location-Aware-Mobile-App

My Places’’ is a Location Aware Mobile
application developed for the android platform. The application is mainly based on Node.JS framework to
serve clients and has Firebase Real Time database as its database.
The app allows user to look for the nearby places like cafés, hotels and message users in the friends list. Also a
user can text search - to look for different places, view the images of a place, and also the associated contact
information about that place.

The system involves 4 components, Firebase Real-time database, Node.JS server, the android client and
Google places API web services. The node server is deployed so the client directly issues requests to Node.js
server and the server responds back to the android client through the API hosted on the server.
